# Remarkjs Template

## Fonts

I've assumed the standard Lato and Menlo fonts are locally installed.
If that's not the case, you may need to include and adjust the fonts.
The default _index.html_ at the remarkjs github page includes custom fonts.

## Clues

* Open _index.html_ and press `?` for help.
* Don't forget to edit the `<title>` tag in HTML.

## Themes

Add one of the following to the `<html>` element:

* `class="default-theme"`
* `class="black-theme"`
* `class="dark-blue-theme"`
